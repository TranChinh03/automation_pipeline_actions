## âœ… Automatic Promotion Targets (CI/CD)

The automated promotion workflow uses **Logic Names** below to find the actual **Git Branch Name** defined in **`.github/environments.json`**.

Please **mark (x)** the target **Logic Names** you want to promote to:

- [ ] sit
- [ ] uat
- [ ] staging
- [ ] production

ðŸ§  **Note**: If your target environment branch name has changed (e.g., from 'sit' to 'sprint_1_sit'), only the **.github/environments.json** file needs to be updated.
